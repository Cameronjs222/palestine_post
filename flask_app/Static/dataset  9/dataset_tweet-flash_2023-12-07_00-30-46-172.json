I am concerned that the bill allows unlimited borrowing with no debt ceiling cap through January 1, 2025, that the IRS will still have $70.6 billon to hire IRS agents, and that able-bodied adults who are experiencing homelessness are now exempted from work, job training, or drug rehabilitation requirements to receive SNAP benefits. Instead of advancing a system that makes people reliant on government programs that were designed for temporary assistance, we need to help those experiencing homelessness prepare for work and find jobs so they can get off of the streets permanently.",
