But our work is far from over. \n\nToday, women continue to face a pay gap – earning 82 cents for every $1 a man earns. And that gap is even wider for communities of color. We cannot lose sight of the Equal Pay Act’s goal: to close this income gap & guarantee true pay equality for all Americans regardless of gender.",

  "text": "NEW – Last year, I compiled a comprehensive review of the Afghan SIV program to ensure we uphold our commitment to those who stood beside U.S. troops and diplomats for over 20 years in Afghanistan. Today, I’m releasing new legislation to address the systemic problems I uncovered.\n\nWe need more visas. And we need a strategy to address the backlog that’s preventing our allies from safely coming to the U.S. That’s what my bill directly addresses. I’m proud to work with Senator Wicker on this bipartisan effort to keep our promise to our Afghan allies.\n\nIt is a promise that has long united Democrats and Republicans - we must stand by our allies. I urge lawmakers to remember that and to join our bipartisan proposal.",
