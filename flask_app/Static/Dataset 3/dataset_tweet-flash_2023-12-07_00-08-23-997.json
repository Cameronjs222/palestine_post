  "text": "September 11, 2001 changed our world and our nation forever. 3,000 of our fellow Americans—mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends, coworkers—were murdered in the most vicious terrorist attack in American history.\n\n9/11 also changed the lives of countless young men and women who saw the threat facing their fellow Americans and answered the call to duty. It’s been 22 years since that devastating terrorist attack, and the United States, thank God, has not been hit with a major terrorist attack in the intervening period. Why? Because countless young men and women, who were inspired to serve their country in a variety of ways, took the fight to the enemy overseas and relentlessly hunted down those who were responsible, while preempting other attacks on America.\n\nOver the years, while on Marine Corps duty at bases throughout our country and the world, I’ve come across memorials commemorating the lives of the strong, young Marines and sailors killed in action over the past 22 years defending our nation, many of whom were inspired to serve because of #September11. Their stories are remarkable—in the prime of their lives with limitless possibilities, and they chose to sacrifice their own dreams and futures for the protection of all of us. They truly represent the best of America.\n\nOn Patriot Day, we re-commit ourselves to this same heroic ethos of self-sacrifice and an uncompromising resolve to hunt down and defeat those who wish to murder Americans, destroy our freedoms, and threaten the American way of life. May God continue to bless the United States of America. #NeverForget",

What I’ve learned working closely with the recovery community is that addiction is not a moral failing. It can affect literally any person—of all ages, backgrounds, races and socioeconomic statuses.\n \nWhile I strongly advocate for harsh penalties for dealers who bring deadly substances, like fentanyl, into our communities and who profit off of this deadly epidemic, I also firmly believe that people struggling with addiction deserve empathy and compassion, especially our young people being taken at shockingly high rates.\n\nI want to thank Sandy Snodgrass and Karen Malcom Smith for hosting a powerful event on the Park Strip, holding up the memory of the Alaskans we’ve tragically lost, and building connections that are the key to recovery and overcoming this crisis.",

  "text": "One of the most impressive men I’ve ever met passed away today at the age of 100. James Buckley was a World War II veteran—a U.S. Navy officer who served three years in the Pacific, a U.S. Senator, a senior Reagan State Department official, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a patriot, a statesman, a man of impeccable integrity and deep faith, a dear friend and mentor, and a shining and inspiring example of a life well lived, and a life lived in full.\n\nOver 30 years ago, during my last year of law school, I had the great fortune of being hired by then Judge Buckley as a law clerk/intern when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. This lucky break developed into a lifelong friendship and mentorship with me, and Judge Buckley and my then girlfriend, Julie—now my wife of 29 years.\n\nJulie and Judge Buckley had a very special connection concerning Alaska. In 1971, when Judge Buckley was then U.S. Senator Buckley, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, or ANCSA—the largest indigenous lands claim act in history—was being debated. Alaska Native leaders from across the state came to D.C. to lobby for the bill. One of those leaders was Julie’s mother, my mother-in-law, the beautiful and brilliant Mary Jane Fate. Her personal efforts turned Senator Buckley—a conservative senator from New York State—into a strong proponent for ANCSA and Alaska Native self-determination and empowerment. For Judge Buckley, this built on a lifelong interest and involvement and commitment to Alaska and the Arctic. Well into his 90s, Judge Buckley would come almost every summer to visit our state. Julie, her parents and I had such memorable meetings and dinners with him during his visits to Alaska.\n\nOf course, this connection continued even to the present day where Julie and I were honored to share dinner with Judge Buckley on a regular basis in D.C.\n\nJames L. Buckley left his mark on the American soul and American history and American heritage. He will be remembered and will be greatly missed by countless Americans. Our prayers and deepest condolences go out to his wonderful family and his many friends and admirers",

This decision also broadly undermines the economic interests of all Alaskans. It appears willfully naïve to conclude, as this court does, that the Biden administration’s \"temporary pause\"—issued on day one of the administration—is not an effort to subvert the law and indefinitely block lawfully-issued leases.\n\nPresident Biden and Secretary Haaland have undertaken numerous actions to delay ANWR development, without regard for the law Congress has passed. This insidious game plan has been played out endlessly on resource development projects in our state. We are witnessing a persistent, coordinated strategy to weaponize never-ending \"review\" and \"consultation\" to circumvent the law and undo years of work of previous administrations and career scientists and staff. Death by delay.\n\nI will continue to fight this unilateral targeting of the economy of our state with every tool at my disposal.",

  "text": "GREAT NEWS: The Ninth Circuit has granted a stay, allowing Southeast Alaska’s troll fishermen to proceed with their scheduled July 1 season, in spite of the outrageous ongoing lawsuit filed by a radical Washington environmental group. \n\nMy team and I have been focused like a laser for months to make sure our fishermen can fish. It’s frustrating that these Alaskans—who’ve done nothing wrong—have been left in limbo for weeks as their season opener approached, but I am thrilled the court heard our arguments, including those articulated in the amicus I led with my congressional delegation colleagues. Importantly, the court also listened to communities, local governments, tribes, and the State of Alaska, all of whom banded together to prevent the substantial economic hardships facing these Alaskans.\n\nThis stay doesn’t mean the fight is over, but it will allow trollers to go fishing while we sort this out in court. It is patently ridiculous to believe a small boat, hook-and-line troll salmon fishery hundreds of miles away is having more of an impact on the sustainability of Puget Sound orca whales than the toxins, pollution, noise, and vessel traffic in their own back yard. With this victory, we will renew and continue our effort to defeat this misguided and manipulative lawsuit and continue defending the livelihoods of thousands of Alaska families in our coastal communities. 🐟",

  "text": "Non-partisan judicial commissions going back 50 years have determined the Ninth Circuit suffers from \"serious difficulties with backlog and delay\" due to its immense size and scope. Those deficiencies have only gotten worse with time and the explosion of growth in the American West, leaving citizens under the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction—including all Alaskans—with less-than equal access to justice. \n\nAs a former Ninth Circuit law clerk, I saw firsthand the court using shortcuts to manage its workload. The solution—splitting the Ninth Circuit—shouldn’t be controversial. We’ve split circuits and created new ones in the past to address the changes in our country’s population. What is controversial is stubbornly maintaining the status quo and undermining millions of Americans’ faith in their own access to justice. \n\nIt is time for members of Congress to put the politics aside, end the delays and shortcuts, and finally approve these critical new judgeships and a new circuit court. \n\n@MikeCrapo, @lisamurkowski, @SteveDaines, @SenatorRisch & I just introduced the Judicial Efficiency Improvement Act of 2023. 👇\nsullivan.senate.gov/newsroom…",

  "text": "Happy 100th Birthday to Dr. Henry Kissinger. His life story is an inspiring example of the American dream: A refugee from Nazi Germany at the age of 13, he later served in the U.S. Army in WWII. He became one of America’s most renowned statesmen and diplomats as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Decades after this service to America, Dr. Kissinger continues to serve by mentoring Americans and world leaders, imparting his wisdom and insight on today’s national security challenges.  Even at the age of 100, he continues to write incredibly insightful books on American history, foreign policy and leadership — I just finished his book entitled “Leadership” and it was exceptional. I’ve had the honor of meeting with Dr. Kissinger many times, including this past January where we spent over an hour discussing current national security challenges. Thank you for your remarkable service to America, Dr. Kissinger, hope you are having a wonderful birthday celebration!",

  "text": "With the passing of Ambassador C. Boyden Gray today, America lost a brilliant legal scholar, public servant and American patriot. His service to our nation spanned decades and so many important areas: Supreme Court law clerk, U.S. Marine, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, U.S. Special Envoy for Eurasia Energy, and, most impressive—eight years as White House counsel to Vice President George H.W. Bush, and then four years as White House counsel when George H.W. Bush became President.\n\nAmbassador Gray always made time to mentor the next generation. I had the honor of both working with him and learning from him for many years. He combined a brilliant intellect with a wonderful sense of humor and infectious laugh. He lived a life in full for our great nation. Julie and I are keeping his daughter, Eliza, and all of his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.\n\nWe will miss you, Boyden. Rest in peace and Semper Fi.",
