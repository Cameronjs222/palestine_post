Today, I introduced the Improving Atmospheric River Forecasts Act, legislation that would lead to better atmospheric river forecasting to mitigate the loss of life and property.\n\nAdditionally, better forecasting will allow us to capture more water from atmospheric river events to help vulnerable communities withstand the dry season. This legislation will equip us with the tools to fortify our communities against severe weather and better utilize the precipitation to insulate those same communities against drought; a win-win for California.\n\nRead more here: mikegarcia.house.gov/news/do…",

  "text": "This #ArmedForcesDay, I’d like to honor all of our active-duty servicemembers, who are our nation’s secret weapon. America is the greatest nation on earth because of the heroes who fight to preserve the freedoms and liberties we enjoy. Expressing our gratitude to these patriots will never be enough. For far too long the welfare of our troops has gone without a shepherd in Congress, without leadership in the Pentagon, and without a true champion. That ends now.\n\nEarlier this year, my Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act was signed into law - one of the biggest pieces of legislation in support of active-duty military families in history. This law grants military spouses professional license reciprocity when moving to a new location on orders. I also introduced the RAISE Minimum Base Pay Act, which would raise pay for our junior enlisted servicemembers to a minimum of the equivalent of $15/hour ($31,200/year). Our troops are our nation’s secret weapon and it’s time we treat them as such.",

On #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay, I’d like to honor our military spouses for their service to our nation. I’ve led in Congress on all fronts to improve the quality of life for these heroes and the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act that I introduced is now law. This is one of the biggest pieces of legislation in support of active duty spouses in history.\n\nMilitary spouse unemployment rates have been around 22% for decades. This law grants military spouses professional license reciprocity when moving to a new location on orders - for example, teachers, nurses, cosmetologists, etc. By allowing this license reciprocity, military families can remain dual-income households upon relocation. I’m committed to the fight in Congress to improve the quality of life for our military families.",

  "text": "I want to thank all of our educators for the work they do on #TeacherAppreciationWeek.\n\nLast month, I introduced the Cash to Classrooms Act, legislation that would deliver more funding to our classrooms by prohibiting states from using an “Average Daily Attendance” funding formula. This formula is utilized by 7 states, including CA where roughly 8.6% of school funding is withheld from our teachers and students due to absenteeism issues. If passed, my bill would help teachers and students alike by giving them full funding. Whether a class is half empty or completely full, our teachers still put in the work to educate our children, and they deserve adequate funding.",
