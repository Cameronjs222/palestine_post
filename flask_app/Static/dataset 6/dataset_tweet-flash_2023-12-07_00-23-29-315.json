The turnout by our community, and the outpouring of love and support for the survivors and victims’ family members in attendance was heartwarming. As we lit torches and placed flowers in their memory, our community mourned together as we heard moving stories from survivors and loved ones. As the search for Conrad continues, please continue to pray for our brave first responders who continue their search, and for those we’ve lost and their families, that God will continue to hold them in the palm of his hands.",

  "text": "Next month, we will be celebrating 3 years since the signing into law of the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) which guaranteed funding for many public lands, including national treasures such as the First National Back of the United States. Earlier today, Independence National Historical Park (INHP) announced a historic $22.2 million investment, made available through the GAOA, to rehabilitate the First Bank by the 250th anniversary of our country. The First Bank is deeply rooted in American history as it was a central part of Alexander Hamilton's vision to create a national financial system that would knit together the economies of the 13 newly independent states while also serving as one of the most important artifacts of George Washington's presidency. I am proud to have helped lead the effort of the passage of the GAOA so many other historical landmarks can be preserved and I am proud to have supported the INHP throughout this process!",

  "text": "With the upcoming one-year anniversary of the 988 roll out, I was proud to accept the 988 Crisis Response Champion Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline is a vital tool to help anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. It consists of a network of more than 200 crisis centers across the country that provide a free 24/7 service to anyone who needs assistance. By calling or texting 988, a person will be in touch with a mental health professional to receive the support he or she needs. As co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I will continue to support additional funding for the implementation of 988 in all fifty states. We’ve come a long way in how we respond to mental health crises, but there is still much more we can do to save lives. That’s why I will reintroduce the 988 Implementation Act, which will bolster the behavioral health crisis continuum of care nationwide and ensure that the lifesaving 988 Suicide Prevention Hotline is fully implemented.",

The Wall lists the names of more than 58,000 men and women who gave their lives or who remain missing in action in the name of freedom.  Dedicated in 1982, this Memorial attracts nearly 5 million visitors each year.
