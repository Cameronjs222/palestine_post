Residents should continue to monitor the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center, local media and official social media accounts from public safety agencies for the latest information.\n \nForecasters predict the most significant impacts are expected in the eastern Midlands throughout the coastal plain with 4 to 8 inches of rain. The strongest winds will occur in the easternmost portion of the state. Downed trees and power lines are likely. Heavy rainfall will result in flash flooding. Minor to moderate river flooding is also possible across portions of the state. Isolated tornados are also possible.”\n \nVisit our website below for severe weather resources: \nfry.house.gov/services/disas…",
