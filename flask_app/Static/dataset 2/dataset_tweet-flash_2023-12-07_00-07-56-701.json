  "text": "President Biden has established a secret nuclear deal with the Iranian regime that is being kept from Congress and the American people. \n\nToday‚Äôs news confirms there has already been a side deal including a $6 billion ransom and the release of Iranian operatives.\n\nNevertheless these are only the barest outlines of the staggering concessions that Biden has already made and intends to make to the Ayatollah, including an additional $10 billion transfer and indeed hundreds of billions of dollars by not enforcing oil sanctions. \n\nMeanwhile he has allowed the Iranian regime to all but acquire a virtual nuclear arsenal over the last two and a half years.\n\nThe Biden administration must keep their deal secret because if they disclosed it, the law requires them to come to Congress and defend it, and this appeasement is utterly indefensible. \n\nInstead they will continue lying about their policies until Congress forces them to do otherwise.",

It was horrific‚Äîand an act of war. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four other plotters who planned the 9/11 attacks are mass murderers who deserve the death penalty. Despite this, the Biden administration was prepared to give them a plea deal. That would have been outrageous.\n\nI pressed the Department of Defense and urged the administration to support the death penalty for these monsters. The victims of those attacks have been patiently awaiting justice for over 20 years, and the Biden administration should not be standing in the way of that.\n\nToday, the Biden administration took a step in the right direction by rejecting the defendants‚Äô plea deal, and I hope we can move forward and try the murderers. I, along with millions of Americans, believe justice requires the ultimate punishment for their horrific crimes.\n\ncruz.senate.gov/newsroom/pre‚Ä¶",
