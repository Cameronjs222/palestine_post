In many ways, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, still seem like yesterday, when almost 3,000 people were murdered by terrorists on American soil.\n\nThe numbers 9-11 represent so much more than a tragic anniversary. It's a daily reminder of how blessed we are to live in this nation. However, that blessing is a target for evil, and we must never turn a blind eye to those who seek our destruction. I pray our future generations never forget this lesson.\n\nAnd I pray that God would continue to bless this incredible nation. 🇺🇸",
