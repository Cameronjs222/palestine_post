  "text": "It is truly amazing to watch in real time as the actions of the Biden administration shift once large numbers of illegal immigrants arrive in big, urban blue cities and political allies and the coastal elites begin complaining…they never cared when it was just the “border towns” and “border states” that had to bear the brunt of the crisis they created.  They’ve gone from literally crying at the border for the cameras, to picking up and restarting construction of the border wall.\n \nBut don’t be fooled; this money to continue the wall (only 20 miles) has been available to the president since he took office — instead he halted construction and even started auctioning off the steel that was to be used for it. The Biden Administration can see the polling on this issue as well as you can…but the damage has already been done, with millions upon millions of illegal immigrants, gang members, drug dealers, human traffickers, and who knows what all walking through the southern border – more than the population of many states. And it’s going to take a hell of a lot more than building 20 miles of wall to deal with all those illegals and stem the tide of record high illegal crossings.",

I learned priceless lessons about the values of hard work, integrity, putting service before self, and striving for excellence. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, and I wouldn’t trade a single day of my Air Force career for any amount of money.\n\nSpecial thanks to all who served alongside me, to those who blazed the trail before us, and to the brave men and women who are serving today.",

No one was certain it would actually work, because it had never been tried before, but we know now that it did work – and our Constitution created the Free World.\n \nI supported and defended our constitution through a 26+ year military career in the USAF, and I am proud to support and defend it today in my daily duties as your U.S. Representative.

The inquiry action will allow Congress to gain access to more evidence that the administration is refusing to hand over. We know the President has not been honest with the American people – we know this through compelling evidence already uncovered: phone records, emails, fake email accounts, texts, contracts, influence peddling payments from hostile regimes to the confirmed existence of a multitude of Biden family shell companies, IRS whistleblower testimony, etc. The American people deserve answers…they deserve the truth.",

  "text": "Many of you probably heard that over the weekend President Biden said he hasn’t “had the occasion to go to East Palestine.” He did, however, find time to go to Philadelphia today for what was essentially a campaign rally. He’s had plenty of time for other vacations – in fact, too many to count. It’s now been just over 7 months -  213 days since the derailment and 186 days since he promised he would visit. He’s had multiple opportunities.  Sadly, the only reasonable explanation at this point for his choosing not to visit is that he simply doesn’t care.",

  "text": "Tomorrow marks the beginning of Ohio’s sales tax holiday weekend. This relatively new annual tradition allows Ohio families to purchase school supplies and clothing for the upcoming school year without having to pay sales tax. I advocated for sales tax holidays long before I was elected to Congress. In fact, I led a grassroots effort to introduce the concept of this temporary tax relief in the state legislature in 2009. I’m glad to see it’s happening annually now for all Ohioans. Make sure to take advantage of the savings before the end of this weekend…and if possible, try to support a local small business at the same time!",

I asked them to speak freely, without media present, so I could relay their messages back to the U.S. EPA and other federal agencies, the Ohio EPA, local authorities, and Norfolk Southern Railroad.\n \nI heard many concerns from residents and business owners who continue to struggle to put their lives back together. There’s no doubt that progress has been made over the last six months…but that certainly does not mean it’s close to completion. I’ll continue to be here as often as I can to ensure the citizens of East Palestine are not forgotten.\n \nThank you to Councilwoman Linda May for coordinating this morning’s discussion.",

I am a cosponsor of this bill. \n \nI find it deeply troubling that some in the children’s medical field are pushing destructive treatments -- such as gender altering surgeries and puberty blocking drugs – on boys and girls.  That is why this reauthorization of funds will go only to hospitals NOT performing these types of procedures. I will not support sending taxpayer dollars to hospitals performing these permanent, life-altering procedures on children.",

  "text": "Yesterday, a federal judge ordered Biden Administration officials to stop colluding with Big Tech to illegally censor Americans. The judge’s ruling essentially told the federal government to stop using social media companies to censor ideas it doesn’t approve of. Without this injunction, there is nothing stopping the feds from continuing to censor political speech…and, we’ve already seen over the last few years that they have no problem doing exactly that. There has never been an administration in American history that is more willing to abuse its power and suppress free speech than the Biden Administration.\n \nThe United States does not need a “Ministry of Truth” from this President or any other.\n \nIf you watch or read any mainstream news organization about this ruling, you’ll see that Big Media is very upset, which is ironic, because you’d think journalists would be in favor of First Amendment protections, not disdainful of them.",

It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.”\n \nAdams' words were prophetic….today is a call for all Americans to reflect on our great experiment that began nearly 250 years ago, and to remember that our unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are granted by our Creator, not government.  Happy Independence Day!",

  "text": "Today, thankfully, the US Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s proposed student loan bailout program.\n\nNow, I don’t wish the burden of debt on anyone…trust me, I’ve been there myself. But the federal government has no right to transfer the financial burden of a person’s decision to take out a loan onto American taxpayers who had no input on that decision. That’s what President Biden’s “forgiving” student loan debt program would have done – the money would have had to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is from you - the taxpayer. For the most part, it would have been a transfer of wealth from the working class to the upper class…because most student loan debt belongs to people pursuing advanced degrees who already have their careers well underway. It’s a fundamentally unfair idea…not to mention completely unconstitutional and a violation of the separation of powers as defined in the Constitution. No President — neither this one nor any future one — should have the power to unilaterally make a decision to make American taxpayers pay off other American’s loans…not even student loans.\nToday, the Supreme Court agreed. The only downside is that we have three Justices who don’t believe this was a gross overreach of executive power.",

Coming from his home state of California, Speaker McCarthy uniquely understands the importance of reclaiming America’s energy independence…he knows energy security is national security. Tours like this offer our elected officials an insight into the importance of American energy producers that harvest our abundant and clean natural gas, the pipelines that transport that gas to market, and the local companies that work so hard to make it all happen. \n\nWe had great conversations surrounding H.R.1 - the Lower Energy Costs Act. This afternoon's tour demonstrated just how much we need to increase the production of our own natural energy resources and cutback on unnecessary government red-tape. Thank you to the Speaker for coming to our area to highlight the importance of American energy independence.",

  "text": "I voted for the resolution to censure California Rep. Adam Schiff tonight.\n\nThere is zero question that as chairman of the Intelligence Committee during the Trump presidency, Rep. Schiff lied, made misrepresentations, and abused sensitive information. He made up false statements from the transcript of a Presidential conversation in a congressional hearing, was dishonest about his contact with the whistleblower, and let out selective leaks. Indeed it was Rep. Schiff who repeatedly promised “ample evidence” of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign…of course, he never produced it, because he couldn’t – it didn’t exist.\n\nHis dishonesty unfortunately made him a hero to many on the left, because he was telling them what they wanted to hear – instead of the truth -- while boosting his own profile. That was his choice. Tonight the House made the choice to censure him – making him only the 9thsuch representative to be censured since 1900. He’s totally deserving of this move by the Members of the US House.",

Secretary Austin has now stated he will recommend this action to the President who will make the ultimate determination.\n\nI’ve pursued this relentlessly over the past several years, and will continue to do so until the McGee Family accepts the medal on behalf of Cpl.

  "text": "The #DurhamReport is damning…there’s no other way to put it. While it confirms what many of us have known and/or suspected, it shows clearly the FBI operated as a disinformation service for the Clinton presidential campaign, ignoring its own rules, and blatantly interfering in a presidential election. The whole thing was fake, and the FBI and liars like Adam Schiff knew it from the start. \n\nOne of the worst parts is, still no one has been held accountable; and, in fact, many of the people involved are in their same positions or have even been promoted, including high up in the Biden Administration. If you ever needed evidence of why Washington D.C. is despised by so many, this could be Exhibit A. \n\nThe political weaponization of our intelligence services and law enforcement is terrifying. It should be a concern to all Americans, regardless of political persuasion, and regardless of your feelings about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.",

  "text": "President Joe Biden and his Administration have made it abundantly clear: they will advance their extreme climate agenda, no matter the cost to American taxpayers and no matter the consequences for working families. The EPA’s new power plant rule will further strain America’s electric grid and wipe out decades of work to build the power generation capacity to keep the lights on across the country, dependably, with the flip of a switch. This proposal, if enacted, would disrupt domestic energy security, force reliable coal power plants to close, and make new natural gas plants almost impossibly difficult to get up and running.  But, that’s the goal of the Biden administration.",
