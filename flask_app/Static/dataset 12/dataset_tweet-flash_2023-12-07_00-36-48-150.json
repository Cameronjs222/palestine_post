Burisma needed Hunter Biden‚Äôs help because the company was under investigation by Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. The cloud of illegitimacy surrounding Burisma due to the prosecution prevented it from raising capital in the United States. Following Hunter‚Äôs hiring, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold billions of dollars of loan guarantees for Ukraine unless Viktor Shokin was fired.",
