  "text": "As a strong conservative at the state and federal levels, I have always fought for faith, family, freedom, limited government, a free market economy, and personal responsibility. I have advocated strongly that we can accomplish these goals if those of us who believe in them unify. We cannot make the needed changes in this country if we’re constantly attacking one another. \n\nYesterday, a small faction of House Republicans, along with Democrats, brought our momentum to a halt - all investigations, as well as the progress we’ve made in drastically cutting spending. While I am disappointed in what happened today, it’s time for Republicans to band together to restore our nation to one that is free, safe, and full of opportunity for all.",

Last week, Republicans introduced a temporary funding bill, which I supported, that cut spending and helped secure the border, while we continue working on appropriations bills. Unfortunately, that bill failed. I voted against the continuing resolution which passed on Saturday because it failed to address these important issues.\n\nloudermilk.house.gov/news/do…",

This means recovering them in their entirety, without redaction. The records sent to the White House and DHS are House records and must be returned immediately. Now the White House wants to redact testimony given to the Democrat-controlled J6 Committee and other records. What are they trying to hide?",

Whether you support Trump or not,  you have to admit Trump is being charged with things that have been standard operating procedures for Democrats for decades. From Hillary Clinton mishandling classified documents, to Nancy Pelosi claiming the 2016 presidential election was stolen, and House Democrats objecting to Trump’s electoral college certification, these actions seem to be acceptable if you’re a Democrat, but traitorous if you’re a Republican.",

She was tasked with reviewing and disseminating intelligence up the chain of command in the leadup to J6. This is important because J6 was a massive intelligence failure.",

I opposed the U.S. sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, but this amendment failed to make it into the final bill.

  "text": "Six years ago today, a gunman radicalized by far left-wing political rhetoric, walked up to where republicans were practicing baseball in the DC area and began shooting at me and my teammates.\n\nThe gunman was angered by the direction conservatives were taking our country and wanted to stop us. His eight-minute deadly rampage didn’t deter me then, and neither has an assassination attempt or false accusations since. These have only strengthened my resolve to restore an America that is free, safe, and full of opportunity for everyone.",

Unfortunately, the President didn’t do this, and Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews was prevented from taking down the suicide bomber when he had him in his sights.",
