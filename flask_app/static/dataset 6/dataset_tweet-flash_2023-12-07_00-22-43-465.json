Because Mr. Smith has not yet used the license, the agents had nothing to inspect and had no choice but to leave.\n\nATF agents also showed up unannounced later that evening at his store manager’s home, despite the manager not being involved in the sale of firearms or the business of Gulf Coast Gun. The manager was not home, so ATF agents gave him a menacing call and said: “Don’t worry, we know where you work.”\n\nThe ATF’s harassment of law-abiding FFLs is clear and documented. We need answers from ATF Director Steven Dettelbach immediately. \n\nREAD: breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/…",

  "text": "🚨 Important Announcement Regarding Hurricane Idalia 🚨\n\nAs many of you are aware, Hurricane Idalia is making landfall in Florida. Please make sure you and your family are prepared and up to date on the projected path of the storm. To help you ensure your and your family's safety, below are tips to keep in mind for not only this storm but hurricane season in general.\n\nPrepare a kit. Ensure you and your family have a disaster kit ready to go in case of an emergency. For more information on items to include in a kit, visit ready.gov/hurricanes\n\nGet to know your surroundings. Know the elevation of your house and property. Hurricanes often bring storm surge, which is considered the greatest threat to property and life during any tropical storm. Know your communities' evacuation routes and how you would evacuate to higher ground. For more information on potential storm surge areas visit nhc.noaa.gov/surge/\n\nConsistently check the weather. The Coast Guard's mobile app for boating safety is a tool to check marine weather from your phone. With the mobile app, you can check the weather at nearby NOAA buoys, which provide wind speed and direction along with wave height. Checking the weather any time you plan to get underway and throughout your time on the water is highly recommended.\n\nSecure your boats. Review your hurricane plan with your local marina to ensure you have a plan to both bring your boat in and strap it down ashore or otherwise ensure it is properly equipped to ride out the storm at the marina.\n\nListen to local officials. When it comes to hurricane response and preparedness, the most important link in the chain is you: prepare your boat for the season, have a hurricane-mooring plan, and monitor channel 16 on your VHF radio when on the water. Prior to planning a trip, keep an eye on the weather, port conditions, and other hurricane warnings.\n\nMy staff and I are continuing to monitor the storms closely. Visit my website at gaetz.house.gov for additional contacts, information, and preparedness tips. Please stay safe!",

After demanding access, the information was exclusively shown to me, and I was able to speak with one member of the flight crew who took the photo.\n\nThe image was of a UAP that I am not able to attach to any human capability, either from the United States or from any of our adversaries.\n\nThe pilot said he encountered a fleet of UAPs in diamond formation over the Gulf of Mexico, which was confirmed on radar that I reviewed.\n\nHe said approaching the UAPs caused video and other aircraft security features to malfunction. He saw what I can only describe as an orb - not of any human capability that I'm aware of.\n\n#UAPHearing #UAPTwitter #UAPX",

  "text": "Under the Trump administration, numerous left-wing federal judges issued nationwide injunctions blocking lawful activities to remove illegal aliens from our country. Unlike those decisions, Judge Doughty’s ruling limits itself to prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services; the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; the Department of Homeland Security; the Department of State; and numerous named bad employees from engaging with Big Tech for the purpose of violating our constitutional rights.\n\nWhile I applaud Judge Doughty’s brave stand, the practical effects of his ruling will likely be minimal. But his decision is a shot across the bow of the Biden administration’s censorship industrial complex. Unlike the left-wing decisions that crippled early Trump administration efforts to enforce our nation’s immigration laws, Judge Doughty’s decision is careful to note that the federal government is not blocked from speaking with Big Tech about ongoing criminal or national security matters. The decision is carefully reasoned and fair.\n\nIn the absence of an executive branch willing to uphold the Constitution, the task of threading the needle of protecting our nation, enabling adequate law enforcement, and protecting our cherished civil liberties is a job, right now, for Congress. I am proud to serve on our House Select Subcommittee on the @Weaponization of the Federal Government, serving alongside Chairman @Jim_Jordan. I hope that some of the individuals enjoined under the Missouri v. Biden ruling will testify, voluntarily or under subpoena, before our subcommittee soon.",

  "text": "🚨Important Announcement Regarding Storms And Tornadoes for Northwest Florida🚨\n\nAs of the time of this writing (Friday, 4:00pm CT), Northwest Florida is currently under a severe thunderstorm watch. Storms in and around Florida's First District may strengthen further as this evening progresses. Tornados, extremely high winds, life-threatening storm surges, heavy rain, and flash flooding are all possible. \n \nIf you haven’t prepared already, don’t wait a moment longer — the best time to prepare is right now. Stock up on essential supplies: non-perishable food, bottled water, flashlights, batteries, and generators are all useful. \n \nPrepare a kit: Ensure you and your family have a disaster kit ready to go in case of an emergency.\n \nSecure your boats: Talk with your local marina to ensure you have a plan to both bring your boat in and strap it down ashore or otherwise ensure it is properly equipped to ride out the storm at the marina.\n \nFill your car with gas in advance: If there is an evacuation, traffic is often terribly slow, and gas stations are likely to be sold out.\n \nMost importantly, have a discussion with your friends and your loved ones, to make sure they are prepared, too. Please don't hesitate to talk to your neighbors and family to ensure everyone's safety.\n \nIf an evacuation has been ordered or recommended for your area, evacuate. Evacuation orders are never issued lightly. If the storm is less severe than expected, it’s still better be safe than sorry.\n\nMy staff and I are continuing to monitor the storms closely. Visit my website at gaetz.house.gov for additional contacts, information, and preparedness tips. Please stay safe!",

  "text": "After tonight, only four Republicans will remain in Congress who have never voted to raise the Debt Limit. I’m proud to be among them. Though the Fiscal Hawk is an increasingly endangered species in Washington, we find ourselves hunted nonetheless.\n\nThe Biden-McCarthy Debt Limit deal papers over America’s problems with unknowable sums of debt, gaslighting reckless inflation-inducing spending for years. As Democrats correctly note, it locks in the radical policy choices they have made. Those choices should be reversed, not cast in cement by Republicans.\n\nThe purported policy \"wins\" are largely cosmetic budget gimmicks or waivable at Biden’s whims. As lawmakers have taken the 72 hours to read this bill, it is no surprise that Republicans moved away from the proposal as Democrats have come to love it evermore. Even the Establishment GOP celebrated \"work requirements\" being traded for reforms that make the SNAP program more costly for taxpayers and more accessible to the homeless.\n\nWe can and must do better.",
