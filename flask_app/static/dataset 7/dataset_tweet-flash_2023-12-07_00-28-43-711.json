AND, even though the bill says that the Biden admin has to provide reports to Congress about the spending, they can waive that requirement if they deem it a national security concern to send the money, which they will undoubtedly do. \n\nInstead of trying to convince me to believe a lie and vote for the lie, TAKE THE LIE OUT OF THE BILL.\n\nIt’s UNLIMITED funding for war in Ukraine and the bill text literally says it.",

  "text": "I’m shocked at this hearing. I have not heard one person say they are concerned about the doctor patient relationship when it comes to COVID.\n\nHowever people are screaming, “WE WILL NOT COMPLY” as the Biden admin and Fauci are insanely calling for masks mandates and more funding for COVID vaccines, while some schools are forcibly masking children again - which is CHILD ABUSE. \n\nPeople are also demanding we investigate the federally funded COVID vaccines, which I too have been demanding from the beginning.\n\nWith 983,973 COVID vaccine reports on VAERS and 18,015 deaths reported, why is the Republican led @COVIDSelect committee avoiding investigating the COVID vaccines?\n\nChildren are now being forced to take this vaccine and we know there are serious adverse side effects that could be life threatening. Along with all the reports of myocarditis, miscarriages, severe blood clots, strokes, heart attacks and more. \n\nNone of this has been investigated by our committee that is filled with doctors who are members. \n\nI’m not a doctor and I don’t have to be to tell you right now why there is mistrust in the doctor patient relationship, it’s bc doctors told patients to take a vaccine that caused injuries and even deaths in a percentage of the vaccinated and no one is doing a damn thing about it.\n\nAnd the doctors who did the right thing by prescribing Ivermectin along with a regiment that saved lives were threatened, kicked off social media, and scorned by medical tyrants. \n\nIf you care about public health, then actually listen to the public when they are telling you what’s wrong!",

  "text": "FULL STATEMENT:\n\nToday’s move by Merrick Garland to appoint David Weiss as Special Counsel to investigate (and in reality cover up) Hunter Biden’s criminal career is the latest action in a continuous pattern of corrupt behavior by Joe Biden and his regime. Behavior typically only seen in juntas in third-world nations or early twentieth-century dictatorships in Europe.\n\nThis is a cover-up, plain and simple. This appointment is designed to protect Joe Biden from his exposure to the serious and substantial investigation Republicans are conducting in Congress. This move establishes a firewall to protect the Biden family from their crimes of influence peddling and selling access to “The Brand,” former Vice President Joe Biden. Every subpoena, every record request, every transcribed interview, or any other effort in an impeachment inquiry will be be blocked by this corrupt and unlawful Special Counsel under the guise of an “investigation.”\n\nRepublicans, including the House Oversight Committee, have revealed more information on the crimes of Joe Biden and his son in just seven short months than the corrupt DOJ, especially David Weiss, have in years. That’s exactly why this plot to obfuscate, distract, and ultimately cover-up the Biden Crime Family’s corrupt business model is unfolding before our eyes.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney appointed today, David Weiss, is totally unqualified to conduct any sort of investigation into Biden crimes. Weiss has been derelict in his duty to prosecute Hunter Biden by ignoring mountains of evidence of tax fraud, evasion, and other crimes presented by brave IRS whistleblowers. Weiss has ignored mountains of evidence, most notably the famous FBI 1023 form directly linking Joe Biden to millions of dollars in payments by Burisma executives to have a Ukrainian prosecutor removed from office. And after all of this, Weiss gave Hunter Biden a sweetheart deal on serious charges where he wouldn’t face a day in prison. The entire prosecution of Hunter Biden by Weiss has been a coverup.\n\nNot only is David Weiss unqualified to conduct this “investigation,” his appointment by Garland is illegal and violates federal statute. The qualifications clearly state: “The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States government.” David Weiss is currently the U.S. Attorney for Delaware. Joe Biden’s Attorney General is breaking the law right in our face!\n\nAll of this is happening while President Trump is facing criminal charge after criminal charge in a political persecution like we’ve never seen before in America. Another DOJ Special Counsel, Jack Smith, has launched an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment, on President Trump and on his supporters. This two-tiered system of injustice being rolled out in our country is designed to scare the hell out of Biden’s political opposition and force us into the shadows.\n\nIf you fall in line with the regime, you won’t be punished for the most egregious crimes, but if you dare oppose the regime, your life will be ruined and you’ll be thrown behind bars. There is no clearer example than the treatment of violent and murderous BLM rioters, who had their charges dropped, compared to J6ers, who have been locked up for years.\n\nRepublicans have no other choice but to stand up against this unprecedented tyrannical regime and IMPEACH.\n\nJoe Biden must be impeached. Merrick Garland must be impeached. David Weiss must be impeached. Jack Smith must be impeached. Virtually, every person in Biden’s corrupt, tyrannical regime should be impeached, convicted, and removed from office.\n\nThe Democrats are playing for keeps. They are throwing every political opponent they can in jail. Soon it could be you. Republicans must use every legal tool at our disposal. We have to fight back.",

Throw more bread to the peasants in the coliseum!” \n\nSure Americans won’t notice..",

And he is leading us into WW3 bc Zelenskyy has proof of more Biden crimes.\n\nThis is the FBI’s FD-1023 UNCLASSIFIED form from the FBI’s most trusted informant that reveals then VP Joe Biden took a $5 million dollar bribe from Zlochevsky to get Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired.\n\nJoe delivered by withholding $1 billion in US aid until Shokin was fired.\n\nWe were only allowed to see this unclassified form in a SCIF, but I took notes and told you all exactly what it said. Thank goodness Chuck Grassley had a copy from a courageous whistleblower and released it today! \n\nBut this form is dated June 30, 2020 and nothing was done. Bill Barr was AG at the DOJ and could have prosecuted, instead he handed it off to another US Attorney that did nothing either.\n\nAlso in 2020, before the presidential election, the FBI had the Hunter Biden laptop filled with evidence of multiple crimes including the same proof I showed during the Oversight hearing that Hunter payed prostitutes through his law firm and made sex tapes and posted them on porn sites. All of this was known and reported by banks in SARs reports and on Oversight we have proof of these payments in bank statements.\n\nI ran out of time in the hearing yesterday, but wanted to ask the IRS whistleblowers if Hunter made money (income) by posting many sex tapes with victims he was paying to travel across state lines for sex (Mann Act violation)? \n\nIf so did he report his sex tape income and pay taxes on it?   I think we all know the answer.\n\nThe Biden’s are the most corrupt criminals to ever hold the highest power in the land. \n\nRepublicans can no longer delay, but we need 218 Republican votes to do it.\n\nI’ve been there since day one and so are the American people.\n\nIMPEACH BIDEN!!!",

Ultimately the biggest hypocrisy in modern day history.  A complete and total failure to the American people.  A stain on our nation that the FBI and DOJ are so corrupt and they don’t even hide it anymore.\n\nWe must win in 2024. \nWe must beat these sick people.\n\nWe started winning today in the SCIF reading proof of Joe Biden’s bribery crimes in Ukraine. \n\nUltimately we win in the end.",

  "text": "In 1998 Republicans impeached President Bill Clinton for lying to Congress about a sexual act with an intern.\n\nToday, Joe Biden is truly guilty of much much more.\n\nFrom his willful open border policies that have created the worst national security crisis in our history to the mounting evidence of abuse of power through financially rewarding pay to play schemes with foreign countries, Joe Biden MUST be impeached.\n\nWhile public polling did not support the impeachment of Bill Clinton in that day, national public polling of all voters overwhelmingly supports the impeachment of Joe Biden at 53%, AND 35% of Democrats and 45% of Independents! \n\nRepublicans lost seats in the House following the impeachment of Bill Clinton bc they didn’t have public support, but Republicans could lose if we do not do what is right and follow the will of the people. \n\nThe People are absolutely fed up and are demanding impeachment. \n\nRepublicans are accomplishing great things in the House but failing to impeach will cause us to fall short in the people’s eyes.",

Hunter and his law firm participated in human sex trafficking and money laundering. Hunter is under “investigation” for tax and gun crimes for years with no action from the DOJ. And now we have proof through whistleblowers of Joe Biden himself, as VP, taking money from a foreign National in exchange for policy decisions. \n\nAnd 51 people from the Intel Community LIED and signed their name to a letter saying the Hunter Biden laptop is Russia disinformation and the media regurgitated their big fat lie 24-7 to push the “talking points” for Biden in the 2020 election just because they hated Trump. Politico stated today that they have not yet verified the contents but some of the emails are real, what a sad pathetic joke. Even Hunter Biden has admitted it’s real by suing the lap top repair shop and other mainstream media has verified its real. You only have to be alive and breathing to know that lap top is real and it’s contents are 100% produced by Hunter Biden.\n\nThe most pathetic and disgusting thing about all of this is that Washington knows all about the Biden’s corruption and embarrassing vile behavior and does NOTHING. \n\nWithout full control, Republicans in the House must use the power of the budget and appropriations to remove those who abuse their power to protect criminal elites. \n\nThat is how we drain the Swamp.",

Dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.”\n\nRepublicans have ZERO plans to cut social security.\n\nAbortion is not women’s healthcare, it kills a baby no matter how Democrats wordsmith it.\n\nWe aren’t telling people who to love, we want to protect kids from the Democrat approved child genital mutilation medical industry. \n\nAnd lastly, Republicans have made it clear we support election integrity and now ballot harvesting just like Democrats.\n\nShame on Joe Biden for lying and selfishly deciding to run for re-election just as we are exposing how the Biden’s have gotten rich by influence peddling. \n\nJoe himself has already proven he’s the worst president in history, now we have to prove how corrupt Joe Biden really is.",

What are they doing?\n\nA US troop presence in Ukraine to go to war with Russia was NEVER authorized by Congress.\n\nNow the Biden Administration and DOJ want to arrest a likely low-lever National Guardsman for exposing the TRUTH?? It’s Joe Biden, his Administration, and the Department of Defense that are breaking the law. They are violating the Constitution by inserting us into an armed conflict most Americans don’t want and no American benefits from.\n\nThe National Guardsman that released these Pentagon papers is simply blowing the whistle on what is really taking place at the DOD, yet he’s being treated like a traitor and criminal. It’s the Biden Admin and the DOD who are acting like criminals. They’re the ones who should be held accountable to the American people because of what they’re doing in Ukraine.\n\nOur Constitution and the rule of law exist for a reason, and the Constitution is clear: it is Congress that must vote to go to war. But again, the Pentagon has us involved in a war that Congress never voted to approve.\n\nIt’s time we hold the Biden Administration accountable for breaking the law. #ImpeachJoeBiden",

  "text": "🚨🚨🚨\nSounding the alarm over the dangerous legislation just introduced by Democrats.\n\n🧵Thread 1/5\n\nThe Trans Bill of Rights was just introduced by Pramila Jayapal.\n\nIt’s a sense of Congress resolution, meaning it wouldn’t have the force of law but would lead to laws, and it’s the most insane piece of legislation I’ve ever seen. 10 pages of mentally unstable wokeness. \n\nI’m sure the left’s base will love it, mostly messaging that reveals that Trans are the new protected class replacing BLM.  \n\nIn other words, prepare for Transtifa riots in the future, but I believe these could be worse.\n\nIt calls for the protection of trans people’s rights, namely housing, medical care, safety, and economic security rights. And of course that means ultimately, taxpayers have to pay for it.\n\nThey want to amend the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to ban discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nThat means Trans become a protected class and women’s rights are totally and completely annihilated. Men pretending to be women would not just be equal to women in all areas, they would be preferred and above all women, essentially replacing women.\n\nIt also says to improve conditions for trans in jails and asylum facilities, create community services to support trans abuse survivors, and give priority to trans asylum seekers. Key word there, “priority.”\n\nCalls for a ban on conversion therapy, a type of therapy many former gays, trans, and detransitioners have undergone to successfully change their life.\n\nCalls for codification of Roe v. Wade which would make abortion legal in all 50 states, destroy state rights, and ensure the murder of babies all over America.\n\nCalls for prohibiting the withholding of services to trans people on religious grounds, which destroys religious liberty. \n\nCalls for education laws to ensure students have the right to participate in sports that best align with their gender, and use facilities that correspond to their preferred gender, which destroys Title IV and women’s rights.\n\nAlso calls for trans in schools to have access to curriculum and books that accurately portray the “substantive history and identity of LGBTQI+ people and Black and indigenous people of color.”  Access to those grooming and brain washing books means grooming and brain washing for all children, and parents could not stop it. This would undo the Republican’s recently passed Parent’s Bill of Rights.\n\nAlso calls for getting rid of government restrictions on access to gender affirming care for trans adults and youth.  This means the great laws Republican states have been passing that protect children from Trans surgeries, puberty blockers, and hormones would be wiped out and kids would not be safe anywhere.\n\nThread continued below 👇",

The sheer amount of agents from the bluest parts of the country is unusual and unnecessary to conduct a routine audit. \n\nThis is a prime example of Joe Biden and the Democrats weaponizing federal agencies to silence and intimidate their political opponents. I fear this is just the beginning and they are directly targeting our Second Amendment and our right to protect and defend our families. \n\nI’m proud to have joined my colleagues to do our job and conduct Congressional Oversight on this highly suspect “inspection.”",

  "text": "From our visit at the DC Jail yesterday, Democrat Oversight Committee Members Jasmine Crockett and Robert Garcia (1st time visitors to the DC Jail) sang the Jails praises. \nShame on them for not knowing the long history of outrage in Washington DC about the DC Jail conditions and treatment OR they didn’t do their homework to know that the DC Jail had inmates/defendants clean, scrub, and paint the week before we got there so conditions would look good for our visit.\nThey also criticized Republicans for being kind in our questioning of pretrial J6 defendants yet did not raise any issue at all with the Jail that we were not allowed to speak to any of the other defendants/inmates in other areas of the jail. Why not? Don’t they care about them? \nI talked to many of them on my last visit and they told me plenty about the jail. Some told me about their education and job opportunities that J6’ers didn’t have, others about learning the legal process from Georgetown law students that J6’ers didn’t get to do, and some screamed and begged for help saying they had been in solitary confinement for “4 months” and that sounded the same as J6’ers only longer for J6’ers.\nWhen I asked about trans (biological males) being in the women’s area, Jasmine asked if the jail provided sanitary supplies. Republicans want to keep trans (biological males) out of women’s prisons/jails but apparently Democrats just want to make sure they have tampons.\nJasmine and Robert didn’t care about J6 defendants complaints of no medical treatment even after the doctor told us all about treatments available and showed medical facilities.\nThey didn’t care about J6’ers complaints about the courts and judges and how they are being treated like political prisoners. \nNo, they just praised the jail after our tour. \nEither they like jails and approve of the two-tiered justice system or are easily fooled by fresh paint.\nI think the Oversight Committee needs to hold a hearing so we can continue to investigate the two-tiered justice system that reigns in Washington DC.",

This man assaulted everyone there by blowing a whistle as loud in as he could in other’s ears and tried multiple times to assault me and other members.\n \nMy staff and others like this very nice lady did their best to block him.\n\nHe needs to be arrested and we tried to have him arrested.\n\nMy staffer called 911 and reached an automated recording for several minutes before reaching a human. Reported the guy. She then asked the jail to send out an officer and they refused.\n\nThis is just another example out of a million others that the left does repeatedly without accountability.\n\nFunny thing is the same guy was outside our press conference at the DOJ in 2021.\n\nSounds like a direct threat, “Don’t touch! Touch you die!”",

This is an area controlled by the Cartels according to BP and with the shortage of agents they aren’t just walking around out there to randomly just find something like this.

Hard to be political about those statistics!\nBut the real liar is Bennie Thompson and how he abused his power as chair of the J6 committee to persecute Pres Trump, his admin, and supporters and create the “insurrection” lie about a 3 hour riot at the Capitol that was likely incited by some Fed operatives, Antifa, and a few bad actors.\nDemocrats hide when the truth is in their face and their FAILING agenda is on full display. \nIf they actually showed up at the border they would be forced to either actually be bipartisan and work with Republicans OR just go ahead and admit they are the party of the open borders globalists agenda. \nBut by not showing up, they are just showing everyone they are cowards.",

So blame can’t be placed on Pres Trump because he tried to make sure the Capital was safe.\n\nAlso Mayor Bowser refused the National Guard for DC so she should open for lawsuits too if this is the path they want to go down.",
