The American people demand equal justice, not the two-tiered justice system we see today. We want spending under control, not backroom deals that benefit special interests and pass debt on to our children and grandchildren.\n\n@Jim_Jordan is a fighter who will be relentless in cutting spending, draining the Swamp, and stopping the woke, reckless policies of the Biden Administration, in addition to holding the Biden Crime Family accountable.\n\nWhen the Revolutionary War Began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, history tells us of the ‘shot heard round the world.’ Jim Jordan’s candidacy for Speaker carries the same weight as the shot that rang out that day in 1775. The legislative battle for America is upon us, and conservatives must rally around someone with a proven record of fighting for America.",

I’ve been fighting tirelessly since 2017 to protect the right of faith-based services to be able to operate in South Carolina without having their religious liberty stifled by the government.

The bill passed this afternoon contains ZERO cuts to government spending and ZERO prohibitions against Biden Administration policies.

  "text": "Countless radicals claim doomsday comes from fossil fuels, but then they use fossil fuels to charge their #electricvehicle (EV) or even power their home during natural disasters. If they want to get rid of #fossilfuels, then they need to be consistent and only charge their EVs by using #wind and #solar. Let’s see how many of these self-proclaimed environmental experts are willing to rely on a purely intermittent #energy source. Because the wind doesn’t always blow and peak energy demand is when the sun is going down, we need an all-the-above energy policy. Our sources of energy should work in tandem with one another. For example, South Carolina could utilize solar in combination with nuclear energy to ensure 24/7, reliable, affordable, and clean energy.",

  "text": "For the third year in a row, American’s median income went down. Couple this with the rise in inflation that was reported yesterday and it’s clear that purchasing power is decreasing. In simple terms, $1 buys less today than it did a year ago. Americans know this because they are struggling to make ends meet in Joe Biden’s economy. With groceries and fuel costing more and more, credit card debt is skyrocketing. Last quarter U.S. credit card debt surpassed $1 trillion dollars. As Americans are forced to spend more, they are putting less money into savings. With over 60% of America living paycheck to paycheck, no one should be surprised that last year was the largest single-year spike in poverty rates ever recorded. Biden’s economic policies reward adversaries like China and punish Americans. Like I’ve always said, Americans do better when government gets out of the way.",

  "text": "As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security, I have an obligation to oversee energy providers and ensure compliance with regulations for the industry. According to some reports, Hawaiian Electric removed equipment and power lines before an investigation could be completed into the horrible fire that decimated Maui. Hawaiian Electric recognized in 2019 that it needed to take action to prevent wildfires, but it never hardened or modernized its grid. I’m joining my colleagues on the House Energy & Commerce Committee to determine if the fire was caused by the utility provider failing to harden its infrastructure.",

If you read my newsletters, you know I have been asking for your help locating relatives of these sailors so we could identify these heroes. I’m happy to say that with your help we have found the family members for FC2C James Garland Nations. Initially, we connected with Kenneth, a 2nd cousin to the sailor. Through more research, Kenneth found FC2C Nations’ nephews, Kevin and Cameron. Today, Kevin and Cameron honored James Garland Nations by hanging commemorative dog tags in his memory and ringing a Navy bell.",

I joined my colleagues in the House in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court supporting Texas. The Biden Administration is depending on a 1947 finding that the Rio Grande is completely navigable to justify their suit against Texas. That finding is inaccurate due to changes in river flow and depth. I hope the court justly sides with Texas and reaffirms that states have a right to defend themselves.",

Congress made clear the Mountain Valley Pipeline energy superhighway will be completed to connect the supply in West Virginia to the Southeast.\n\nIn July, I joined two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court to fight back against those wanting to subvert our laws and lead us down a path of energy dependence, grid instability and blackouts.\n\nHere in South Carolina, we are approaching our maximum natural gas pipeline capacity which could result in lost jobs and blackouts. By ending litigation and restarting construction of the pipeline, we can free up more gas in the current lines to power our homes and businesses, with the promise of additional capacity in the future—not to mention reinstating jobs for construction works, increasing investments into local communities across the Southeast as well as the continuing the payment of royalties to landowners.\n\nThe ruling from the Fourth Circuit helps support 24/7/365 baseload power to South Carolina.",

  "text": "As a doctor, you took an oath to do no harm. Further, you know biologically there are only two genders—male and female. It’s time to put an end to the gender transitioning of children. These mutilations of children cause irreversible harm and clearly violate doctors' oaths to do no harm. These procedures are done with minimal counseling of the child and fail to address root issues like mental illness. Gender transitioning children is child abuse. We require you to be 18 to smoke, vote, purchase fireworks, etc. In fact, you must have parental permission to get a tattoo or to change your name if you are not 18. But woke liberals think that you can decide at 4 years old that you want to change your gender. The Democrats don’t want to hear from me on this issue, but I implore you to listen to the de-transitioned individuals that live with constant regret and countless medical complications. If you attempt to gender transition a minor, then you ought to be prosecuted. It’s that simple. I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 3328 the Protecting Children From Experimentation Act of 2023 and H.R. 1399 the Protect Children’s Innocence Act.",

  "text": "I wanted to give you an update on the ongoing legal matters related to President Trump. Jack Smith, on behalf of the Biden Administration, is leveraging Biden’s two-tiered system of justice to full effect to take down President Trump. Jack Smith used a secret grand jury in Washington, D.C. to gather evidence about a case filed in Florida. His actions circumvent the legal process of using the already established, and in-district Florida grand jury to gather evidence. The only reason Americans found out about the secret grand jury was because the Federal Judge overseeing the case in Florida, Judge Cannon, demanded answers from Smith about this legal impropriety while reviewing a motion about conflicts of interest for a lawyer in the case. Judge Cannon is absolutely correct in getting to the bottom of Jack Smith’s circumventing the legal process to smear President Trump. Jack Smith knows that Washington, D.C. is the most political city in the world with nearly every resident working for or having a connection to the Federal Government—and most residents are democrats. Smith knew he couldn’t get everyday Americans on the Florida grand jury to sign off on his persecution of President Trump, so he used an out-of-district grand jury to bypass the normal legal process. The left wants to tell you this is a “fair trail” and that they are only interested in “justice,” but does using secret grand juries sound like fair treatment to you?",

Recently, the Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security looked at draft bills that would improve the efficiency and predictability of NRC licensing, eliminate a superfluous Commission hearing at the end of the licensing process that no stakeholders request, and update NRC practices to incorporate more efficient oversight to free up resources to focus on safety significant matters.",

Unfortunately, President Biden has shown he is willing to go above and beyond the rule of law to impose his gun control agenda and attack the firearms industry.\n \nCongress has the responsibility to provide checks and balances over the Executive Branch to ensure our right to keep and bear arms is not infringed.

I’m thankful for the time we can join together to pray for America, share what God has done and encourage each other to “Keep Your Eyes on Jesus!”\n\nI shared with the SC Delegation about Abraham and Isaac. God wanted Abraham’s obedience more than he wanted his sacrifice—Abraham didn’t know another sacrifice was already there. For us, the perfect sacrifice was fulfilled in Jesus on the cross. It’s amazing to think about an all-powerful God’s love and sacrifice for us.",

Non-lead equipment is more expensive and there is no evidence that lead ammo or tackle causes any negative environmental impact. As an outdoorsman, I’m joining my colleagues, hunters and anglers in opposition to this USFWS policy.",

  "text": "Today, I voted for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is passed by Congress each year to authorize funding levels and allocate funds for our military. In addition to serving as an authorization of appropriations, the NDAA establishes defense policies and restrictions, and addresses administrative matters related to the Department of Defense (DOD). While it is unfortunate that the Biden Administration has attempted weaponize this institution to promote a leftist agenda, this year’s NDAA is a win for national security and is a step forward in returning our military to the non-woke, nonpartisan entity it was intended to be.\n\nThe 2024 NDAA pushes back against the radical woke ideology being forced on our servicemen and women by eliminating:\n❌Funding for sex reassignment surgeries or pharmaceuticals\n❌Pride and BLM flags from military installations\n❌Woke DEI programs and CRT trainings in any form\n❌Funding for drag shows and Drag Queen Story Hours\n\nOf note, I cosponsored an amendment presented by Rep. Jackson to ensure your tax dollars do not pay for abortions. I'm proud of the House for standing for the right to life!\n\nAlso, I proudly voted for Rep. Roy's amendment that prohibits the establishment of senior diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) positions at the DOD. Another vital amendment from Rep. Norman that I voted for protects children by defunding gender transition through an Exceptional Family Member Program of the Armed Forces.\n\nIn addition, House Republicans ensured that the men and women who serve our nation will receive their largest pay raise in 20 years while continuing strong support for their families. Further, this year’s NDAA included critical provisions for financial accountability and oversight of the Pentagon—including a provision to penalize the DOD for cost overruns on major programs and an Inspector General to audit funds to Ukraine. The FY 24 NDAA aids the 8,000 servicemembers discharged for failing to take the COVID-19 vaccine and gives them a path back to service. On top of this, the NDAA puts our national security first by boosting innovation and providing our military with the tools necessary to counter the unprecedented threats we face from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.\n\nFurther, I proudly voted to stop the revisionist history with the renaming of our military bases and buildings but am disappointed this commonsense amendment did not pass the House. Lastly, I stood with Rep. Greene in voting to remove $300 million in funding to Ukraine from the NDAA. Again, a commonsense amendment that the House refused to adopt.\n\nProviding for our national defense is the most important task given to Congress by the Constitution, and the NDAA is a critical part of fulfilling that duty. It’s time for the United States Military to once again operate from a place of peace through strength. The 2024 NDAA accomplishes this by strengthening our Armed Forces and prioritizing our national defense.",

We all knew it was grossly unconstitutional for Biden to redistribute wealth to pay off the debts of students. Estimates say the loan bailout could have cost up to $980 billion in unauthorized taxpayer spending. If you take on debt, you are responsible for paying it back—it’s that simple. Remember, Biden never expected the loan bailout to be a policy, it was just a gimmick for a press release.      Congress should consider punitive sanctions for the Biden Administration given its callous attempt to enact this clearly unconstitutional initiative. It’s great to see a Supreme Court that rules based on the Constitution      and not feelings or extra-Constitutional personal beliefs.",

  "text": "The United States has the capability to be the global leader in nuclear energy, but to do that, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must become a partner that works with stakeholders to bring new projects online rather than simply an impediment. This doesn’t mean moving away from its principles of safety; it just means shifting their mindset and ensuring a streamlined and common sense process for new approvals. Nuclear energy is clean, safe, reliable, affordable, available 24/7/365, and accounts for more than half of our nation’s carbon-free electricity, over 90% of South Carolina’s carbon-free electricity, and over half of South Carolina’s total power generation. Nuclear energy is essential for our grid reliability, national security, and our nation’s energy future.\n\nThat’s why we are providing crucial oversight of the NRC to ensure our policies are modernized to allow our nuclear development to reach the next level.  We need a nuclear regulator that reflects the technological and engineering talent and capabilities of the American nuclear sector to propel us to the next level. The @HouseCommerce Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee is working to provide this accountability over the NRC to pave the way for a robust nuclear energy future.",

  "text": "Today, I was proud to vote for H.J.Res.44 to block the Biden Administration’s rule on pistol stabilizing braces and see it pass the House with bipartisan support. A pistol brace is a stabilizing device mounted to the rear of a firearm, and many wounded veterans, for example, use a pistol stabilizing brace to safely fire a gun with one hand. The ATF previously determined that pistols equipped with these devices were not considered short-barreled rifles and thus subject to NFA regulation. Since this determination, millions of pistol braces have been sold to Americans, but the Biden Administration went back on their word and classified these devices as NFA items without the consent of Congress. This means millions of Americans are subject to 10 years in prison and thousands of dollars in fines, all with a stoke of a pen. Many proponents of this new rule were entirely unaware of the consequences for everyday Americans who purchased these devices legally, and even the Director of the ATF, Steven Dettelbach, did not understand the requirements under this rule. While I applaud the House for passing this resolution, this rule is still in effect. I implore my colleagues in the Senate to quickly take this resolution up and get it to President Biden’s desk to protect law abiding Americans’ right to bear arms.",

Unlike President Trump, Biden had no authority to declassify these documents. So, when is Joe Biden going to be arrested?

  "text": "On June 6, 1944, some 156,000 Allied soldiers invaded the beaches of Normandy as part of Operation Overlord, and thousands of brave Americans gave their lives to defend freedom. This fateful day was a turning point for the Allied troops, and D-Day is now referred to as the beginning of the end of World War II.\n\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote these words to the troops before the D-Day invasion: “The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. … Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped, and battle-hardened. …The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory. I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory. Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.”",

  "text": "For months, Joe Biden refused to negotiate with House Republicans and repeatedly said that he would only sign a debt limit increase that didn’t reduce spending or contain any conservative reforms. After months of work and with the support of the American people, House Republicans convinced him to do otherwise. The Fiscal Responsibility Act caps spending, claws back unspent COVID funds, adds work requirements for welfare recipients, decreases funding for Biden’s IRS army, and reforms energy permitting for oil and gas projects in this country. While I would have preferred much steeper spending cuts, the legislation represents the first year-over-year cut in discretionary spending since 1948. The legislation also contains an important provision from Congressman Thomas Massie that institutes an across-the-board cut in discretionary spending in the event Congress does not follow the normal appropriations process. Having voted against the past six consecutive debt limit increases, I understand exactly what is at stake for our nation if we don’t address spending. I believe this legislation represents an important step in the right direction, which is why after spending days wading through the information and disinformation surrounding the bill, I ultimately felt comfortable supporting it along with conservatives like Jim Jordan and Newt Gingrich. I will continue fighting every day for more fiscal responsibility in Washington to get our country back on track.",

EPA ruling drastically shrinks the scope of the bureaucratic interpretation of the Clean Water Act and reaffirms our freedoms. This ruling is especially a win for farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods were threatened by the Biden Administration’s authoritarian rulemaking.\n\nThe federal government has abused the WOTUS rule to regulate virtually every body of water, from streams to puddles, and this ruling narrows the authority Washington has on the lives of Americans. I am hopeful this ruling will give Americans more breathing room and provide much-needed relief from the burdensome federal overreach on our nation’s waters.",

  "text": "I was granted special permission to temporarily join a different committee for the purpose of questioning Postmaster General DeJoy on ongoing postal issues in the state– issues I’ve been working to address for years now. As a federal representative for over 700,000 constituents, it’s unacceptable that USPS officials have refused repeated requests to meet with my constituents about the issues they’re facing. I’m tired of excuses from USPS, and I want them to take action to address these numerous constituent concerns.\n\nOur office is working on a variety of postal concerns, but two issues where USPS has blatantly refused to engage involve the Savannah Lakes Village in McCormick and at the post office in the town of Laurens. Certain residents in the Savannah Lakes Village are denied curbside delivery service because of an arbitrary 2012 USPS rule that requires cluster box units even though the development was planned and plotted prior to the 2012 rule, and the area is not conducive and is unsafe for cluster box units. The Laurens County Post Office is dealing with a similar issue where constituents are forced to receive their mail at an unsafe location due to the post office’s unwillingness to budge. After years of correspondence from myself, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Senator Tim Scott with the USPS regarding these two issues, they still refuse to meet in-person or conduct an on-site visit with stakeholders to see how their decisions affect their customers. \n\nI’m not asking for USPS to hold a town hall; I’m simply asking them to meet to hear people’s concerns. I now have the Postmaster General on record saying he would meet with us regarding this. I won’t stop pushing until the USPS meets with us and we reach a resolution for my constituents.",

This resolution passed the Republican-controlled House, passed the Democrat-controlled Senate, but was vetoed by Joe Biden today. \n\nWhy would Joe Biden side with China over American jobs, American workers, and a bipartisan coalition in Congress? Biden seems to be interested in “going green” no matter the impact on the lives of everyday Americans, but is that the best strategy for the nation? This was another missed opportunity for the Biden Administration to follow common sense.",

And on Monday of this week, the Biden Administration announced that the COVID shot mandate for CMS-certified healthcare facilities, Federal employees, Federal contractors, and international air travelers will end on May 11! \n\nThis is a win for the American people, a win for medical freedom, and the culmination of years of pushing the Biden Administration to end these draconian mandates.\n\nThe House passed my bill, the Freedom for Health Care Workers Act this year, and I have repeatedly fought the COVID shot mandate at every turn. The authoritarian COVID shot mandates were unscientific and un-American, and I’m glad to see the White House has finally “followed the science” to end federal COVID shot mandates on Americans.",

The Biden Administration is intent on its abortion-on-demand agenda through chemical abortions despite the dangerous implications and side effects of these “DIY abortions” on women and girls, not to mention the life of their unborn child. Chemical abortions by mail not only violate the FDA’s drug approval process, but they also break federal law and endanger the health of women. We are fighting to block the approval of the abortion drug mifepristone to protect the health and safety of pregnant women and their unborn children.",
