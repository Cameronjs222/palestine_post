  "text": "I can’t say this in 1-minute, so:\n\nThe Motion to Vacate (MTV) has been part of House rules since 1801. It has been used to remove one Speaker (using the floor vote). \n\nThe Speakership requires a majority on the floor (not just a majority of the majority) to govern. \n\nWith a narrow majority, clearly enough people had grievances to continue taking down rules and party line votes in perpetuity. Had the motion to table prevailed, Congress would have had more turmoil for longer.\n\nThis reveals the pragmatic reality of the MTV. \n\nIf one person has grievances, the motion to table will prevail, the rules will pass, and party line votes will still overcome the objection. \n\nBut, if the number of people with grievances within the majority work together, every rule and party line bill will fail until the matter is addressed. \n\nCongress ought not fear the MTV. The MTV allows the debate and resolution. Speaker Cannon used it to prevail and broker a functioning majority.\n\nThe majority should heal and narrow the division. This requires a shared vision, and a shared commitment to process. @RepThomasMassie made excellent points about how @SpeakerMcCarthy led many such reforms. Unfortunately, he lost the MTV.\n\nNow the question, can Republicans unite to do what we said we would do? I believe we can because we must.",

If our conference won't fight for our bills, there will never be a negotiation with the Senate.\n\nWe only have a majority if we work together to use it.\n\nIf my proposal works, the Senate would have to eat our bills to keep the government funded and finally pass their own to get to conference... It would be bold, end the OMNIBUS cycle, and inspire voters whose faith in our party is on life support at best IMO.\n\n-Warren",

I.e. vote on all 12 appropriations bills by November 17th. \n\n2) Agree to send the appropriations bills we have passed - and nothing else on those bills until they are either accepted or a conference bill with a Senate passed version is approved.\n\n3) Right now 70% of appropriations have passed the House and more will pass quickly, but for anything not passed inside the 45 days, send a CR that includes our 1% top line cut (Massie CR). \n\nIf our conference won't fight for our bills, there will never be a negotiation with the Senate.\n\nI hope both (and the conference) consider my proposal. I believe this would produce the most effective alternative possible at this point. \n\nWe only have a majority if we work together to use it.",

More ambitious missions advocated by the Biden administration include Crimea or even regime change in Russia with war crimes tribunals for Putin. \n\nUkraine has lost hundreds of thousands of people to keep the war from spreading to NATO. That can be done with diplomacy. Extracting Russia from Ukraine can only be done with far more combat power.\n\nNever forget, Biden's opening offer to Zelensky was a ride out of Ukraine...",

  "text": "Neglecting the Principles of War exposes missions to extreme risk of failure...\n1.  Objective – This is the ultimate purpose of war, to destroy the enemy's ability and will to fight, by directing every operation toward a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable end.\n2.  Offensive – Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Offensive action is the most effective and decisive way to attain a clearly defined common objective while maintaining freedom of action and achieving decisive results.\n3.  Mass – By synchronizing efforts, rather than concentrating forces, at the decisive place and time, a numerically inferior force can achieve decisive results, while limiting exposure to the enemy.\n4. Economy of Force – This is the opposite of mass.  Economy of force is the realization that one must employ power and resources in the most effective and judicious way possible. \n5.  Maneuver – Maneuver is the deliberate alignment to engage the enemy to gain an advantage.  It is used to exploit your successes and to preserve your freedom of action.  Maneuver is a demonstration of initiative.\n6.  Unity of Command – For every objective, you must seek unity of command and unity of effort.  Unity of command means that responsibility and authority align, so there can be accountability - which works if there is unity of effort.\n7.  Security – You should never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage.  Security enhances freedom of action by reducing vulnerability to hostile acts, influence, or surprise.  Security results from knowledge of your enemy and solid planning.\n8.  Surprise – You must strike the enemy at a time, place, and manner for which he or she is unprepared. Surprise can decisively shift the balance of  power and momentum.\n9.  Simplicity – Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure their understanding.",

In my district, there have been 17 mail carriers assaulted since October 2022, including one just last week.

The debt ceiling was lifted, with cuts to current spending, caps to future spending, work requirements, environmental reforms, and more. Time cannot be replaced. \n\nEither a shutdown or a continuing resolution (CR) is inevitable at this point. As we work to complete full appropriations, Congress cannot continue funding a government that refuses to secure its border. \n\nJoe Biden's request for funds not only violates the debt ceiling agreement, it also seeks funding for settling illegal immigrants across America rather than reversing the Biden/Mayorkas policies that have fueled this crisis.\n\nDon't bankrupt America - financially or morally.",

  "text": "RE: Current House Appropriations Debates\n\n🤷 Push everyone to write to the caps that already passed and became “law”? Otherwise, it’s really mutually assured destruction. Some want more, some want less, but there is already a signed agreement on the top line numbers. Just need to allocate $$ and fight for policies.\n\n🤕 Or just blow it up, shut down the government, and either get a CR, an omnibus, or a Hail Mary completion?\n\nI’m solidly in the get policy wins camp - and enforce the caps on everyone.",

  "text": "Neglecting the Principles of War exposes missions to extreme risk of failure...\n1.  Objective – This is the ultimate purpose of war, to destroy the enemy's ability and will to fight, by directing every operation toward a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable end.\n2.  Offensive – Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Offensive action is the most effective and decisive way to attain a clearly defined common objective while maintaining freedom of action and achieving decisive results.\n3.  Mass – By synchronizing efforts, rather than concentrating forces, at the decisive place and time, a numerically inferior force can achieve decisive results, while limiting exposure to the enemy.\n4. Economy of Force – This is the opposite of mass.  Economy of force is the realization that one must employ power and resources in the most effective and judicious way possible. \n5.  Maneuver – Maneuver is the deliberate alignment to engage the enemy to gain an advantage.  It is used to exploit your successes and to preserve your freedom of action.  Maneuver is a demonstration of initiative.\n6.  Unity of Command – For every objective, you must seek unity of command and unity of effort.  Unity of command means that responsibility and authority align, so there can be accountability - which works if there is unity of effort.\n7.  Security – You should never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage.  Security enhances freedom of action by reducing vulnerability to hostile acts, influence, or surprise.  Security results from knowledge of your enemy and solid planning.\n8.  Surprise – You must strike the enemy at a time, place, and manner for which he or she is unprepared. Surprise can decisively shift the balance of  power and momentum.\n9.  Simplicity – Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure their understanding.",

There is more commitment to pass conservative appropriations than at any time since 2016. Unfortunately, this is the most \"conservative\" bill that can actually become law in this divided government. \n\nSince 2016, I have voted NO 10 times on raising the debt limit.

  "text": "The last time America had this much debt relative to GDP (size of our economy)? World War 2. In fact, they reset the global monetary system and knew we needed to spend less. \n\nToday, Biden's only plan is to ignore the math and keep spending. Schumer has no plan. @HouseGOP passed a plan that doesn't even balance - ever - and Democrats pretend printing more money is an option. \n\nAs recent events show, printing money is possible, but you can't control its purchasing power. Inflation is real, it grows the wealth gap, and amounts to theft.\n\nMore freedom.\nLess government.\n#SoundMoney",

Freedom surrendered is rarely reclaimed. \n\nRather than protecting us from international threats, these terrible bills build onto a domestic police state. This is a domestic threat to our Constitution and our way of life. \n\nIt cannot pass and the executive branch cannot be permitted to implement it.\n\nAmerica desperately needs a modern privacy act that applies across all companies and platforms. My proposal, the It’s your data! Act, recognizes that every American has a property right to his or her data and explicitly prohibits sharing the data with any government without a warrant or subpoena.",

  "text": "Senator, what is America’s mission in Ukraine? \n1. Peaceful resolution with no spread to NATO?\n2. No Russians in Ukraine?\n3. Including Crimea (pre-2014)?\n4. War crimes tribunals (regime change in Russia)? \n\nWithout a succinct, principled objective, neither our diplomats nor our warriors can be held accountable for success or failure. Is that part of your plan? \n\nNo mission has been stated despite massive spending and near-tactical participation. \n\nAlso, where is the intel showing Russia’s massive military build-up? If, as you appear to claim, Putin wants conquest across at least Eastern Europe, why was there no major surge in military spending, bigger active-duty forces, or new technology? Happy to review the intel if it exists…",
