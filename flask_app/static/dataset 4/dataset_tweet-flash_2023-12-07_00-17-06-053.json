In my first nine months in Congress, I have seen just how broken Washington is and nothing sums it up quite like the last few weeks. While this bill wasn’t what I would have liked to see, it was the only option on the table to avoid a shutdown at this point. A shutdown would have had a catastrophic impact on our border, military, and government services. \n\nThe work is far from done. The house MUST swiftly pass full-year, fiscally responsible appropriations bills that rein in the out of control spending by the Biden administration.",

A shutdown would have had a catastrophic impact on our border, military, and government services. \n\nThe work is far from done.
