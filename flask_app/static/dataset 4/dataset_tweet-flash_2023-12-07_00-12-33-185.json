  "text": "No for now.\n\nNow is not the time to remove the Speaker and I have decided to vote against the motion to vacate the chair. \n\nI too am frustrated by the broken promises, secret deals, and failed leadership. Time and time again we have seen legislation come to the floor that the majority of Republicans do not support. From using Democrats to pass a CR, to a debt ceiling deal endorsed by Democratic leadership, to even promising different topline budgets to Joe Biden and House conservatives, I am sick and tired of business as usual in the Swamp. \n\nMy focus right now is on getting the federal government funded through 12 individual spending bills like we promised everyone in January, delivering on the priorities of the Third District, and moving forward on the Oversight and Accountability Committee’s impeachment inquiry.  \n\nAnother Speaker fight right now, in my opinion, undermines those priorities at the worst possible time. It would delay the hard work and important fights necessary to get this country back on track. We need to finish the job the American people elected us to do, and I’m here to ensure that happens.",

  "text": "Coloradans know that Joe Biden needs to be impeached. Under his unconstitutional dereliction of duty at the border, our state has been overrun by crime and drug overdoses.\n\nSince Biden took office, overdoses have doubled, drug trafficking has hit a 10-year high, and fentanyl seizures have increased 173% across Colorado.\n\nColorado taxpayers have paid more than $522 million to imprison illegal aliens over the past 20 years. Additionally, each illegal alien costs each Colorado taxpayer $5,191 annually in welfare, education, and other freebies being given out. \n\nUnder Joe Biden's deliberate dereliction of duty, every state is a border state. Coloradans are paying the price for his failure of leadership, and I am advocating for them in Congress with my articles of impeachment.",
