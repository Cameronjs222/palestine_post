  "text": "In June, I voted to release transcripts from interviews with two courageous IRS whistleblowers alleging political interference in the investigation of Hunter Biden. During our closed-door session (which is legally required under section 6103 of the tax code), my Democrat colleagues claimed that they wanted the information aired in public. Ultimately, they all voted against releasing the information.\n\nToday, as we prepare to enter another @WaysandMeansGOP meeting on sensitive whistleblower information, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle join me in voting for transparency. The American people deserve to know the truth about the Biden family influence peddling scheme.",

  "text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland’s move to appoint David Weiss as special counsel in the ongoing investigations of Hunter Biden’s influence peddling schemes that involve many members of the Biden family, including the President, is yet another underhanded move to protect the Biden family.  A SPECIAL COUNSEL is supposed to come from outside of the government to avoid very obvious conflicts of interest.  As such, Weiss should not even be eligible for this role.\n\nRather than continuing to use smoke and mirror tricks, if the Department of Justice had any shred of integrity, they would be indicting Hunter Biden TODAY for crimes they already know he committed because they were in the now defunct plea agreement.  No other American would have avoided an indictment for this long and for so many obvious violations of the law.\n\nIt is clear this latest sham maneuver by Merrick Garland is only occurring because House Republicans continue to uncover and expose the vast web of money from foreign entities, including communist Chinese interests, that have flowed to the Biden family when Joe Biden was Vice President and able to affect policies of our country.  We will continue to investigate further and bring more of this devastating information to the American public.  No one is supposed to be above the law! vanduyne.house.gov/2023/8/re…",

He served as Irving's police chief from 1978 to 1994. Prior to joining @IrvingPD, he served in the National Guard Reserves and spent 23 years at Dallas Police Department. He also played an instrumental role in creating the Irving Police Athletic League (PAL), which provides classes and camps to hundreds of youths each year in Irving and surrounding communities. I would like to thank Chief Newman for everything he has done for our community, and I hope you’ll join me in praying for his family and friends.",

  "text": "If someone (or an entire agency) has proven their inability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars and safeguard against fraud, why on EARTH would you entrust them with additional responsibilities? Clearly, Washington needs a dose of common sense.\n\nToday, the SBA’s changes to its flagship 7(a) lending program take effect, which will weaken lending standards, potentially forcing taxpayers to foot another expensive bill! Regrettably, the SBA failed to heed @HouseSmallBiz’s repeated warnings about these changes, which jeopardize the entire program\n\nWe’re STILL trying to recoup the $220 billion stolen from taxpayers due to the Small Business Administration’s incompetence. Loosening lending standards does more harm than good and makes it more difficult to root out bad actors within the program. Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill AGAIN for the Small Business Administration’s mismanagement.",
