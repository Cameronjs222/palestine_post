His mother refused to let his untimely death go in vain, and their ordeal in 1955 served as a searing catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nThe President’s proclamation today to establish a monument for Emmett and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, is an important step that reaffirms our commitment to confronting the darker aspects of our past – as we strive for a more just future.",
